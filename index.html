                    <p class="blog-post-meta">January 1, 2021 by <a href="#">Pablo</a></p>
                    <p>PlayStation VR is an affordable introduction to quality VR. Many of the experiences aren't as
                        crisp as the ones found on the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, but, for a system that uses a PS4
                        instead of an expensive PC gaming rig, we're not complaining. Plus, a recent price reduction
                        makes it even more appealing.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>PlayStation VR was launched in 2016 and is now the best-selling high-end VR headset ever.</p>
                    <p>It's not surprising, given how tempting a purchase it is if you already have a PS4. Why shell out
                        for a high-performing, room-tracking, PC-tethered headset from Oculus or HTC, when you can just
                        plug something into the console under your telly?</p>
                    <p>As of August 2018, Sony revealed it had shifted more than three million PSVR systems(opens in new
                        tab), while 21.9 million VR games and apps had been sold along with the headset.</p>
                    <h3>PlayStation VR and barriers to VR</h3>
                    <p>But let's not get ahead of ourselves, the current PlayStation VR headset brings the world of
                        virtual reality to your console in a big way. And what really sets it apart from the rest is
                        that it does so without the cost most often associated with rival higher-end VR headsets, like
                        the HTC Vive or Oculus Rift. 
                        Because although these higher-end headsets cost more to run, you also need a pricey gaming PC
                        that can power them, which is a huge barrier to entry for most people.

                    <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-1">Oculus Rift S</h2>
                    <p class="blog-post-meta">December 23, 2020 by <a href="#">Ashley</a></p>
                    <p>The Oculus Rift S is certainly a more approachable entry point into PC-based VR. But its
                        concessions for accessibility haven’t improved the overall experience of entering into virtual
                        worlds.</p <p>
                    If you're  looking for one of the best VR headsets, consider the Oculus Rift S. 
                    Virtual reality has come a huge way since Oculus founder (and controversial VR poster boy)
                    Palmer Luckey first introduced the world to the Oculus Rift way back in 2012. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now owned by Facebook, the Oculus Rift S should represent the next leap forward for the
                        company’s high-end, PC-based virtual reality experiences. But in practice, this is more of a
                        baby-step in terms of upgrades and added features on the original Oculus Rift. What we’re saying
                        is the Oculus Rift S is not a true “Oculus Rift 2” successor. But is definitely a valid
                        contender when it comes to the best VR headsets available to buy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you follow along with technology, the name Oculus Rift S should ring a few bells. That’s
                        because both Apple and Microsoft add an ‘S’ to their products in order to denote an iterative
                        improvement (look at the Xbox One S and iPhone XS for examples), as well as to indicate that the
                        product is backwards compatible and will, in time, replace the original. All of these things are
                        true for the Oculus Rift S
                        And so we have a virtual reality headset that, in many respects, particularly pertaining to
                        accessibility, is superior to its predecessor, the original Oculus Rift. However, this VR
                        headset isn’t the generational leap forward many were expecting. In fact, the Rift S makes some
                        trade-offs that actually feel like a step backwards. In summary, the Rift S is good – but not
                        ‘next-gen’ good.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Price and availability</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Oculus Rift S is available now, and costs $299 / £299 / AU$499. That’s considerably cheaper
                        than the price that the original Oculus Rift entered the market at – though you’re now able to
                        pick up that headset for around the $349 mark, which would be worth considering given what we’ve
                        seen from the Rift S.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s also significantly cheaper than the HTC Vive, Vive Pro and forthcoming Valve Index, its
                        closest competitors, which all require external tracking sensors to work. However, though we’ve
                        yet to conduct a final review of the Valve Index, its money-no-object approach to quality is
                        making it look like the most fully realised VR.

                    <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-1">HTC Vive Pro 2</h2>
                    <p class="blog-post-meta">November 12, 2020 by <a href="#">Ashley</a></p>
                    <p>Introducing a big improvement than its predecessor, which was released in 2018, the Pro 2 comes
                        with a screen with a 120-degree FOV and a full 5K resolution (2448p for each eye), the display
                        also has a refresh rate of up to 120Hz. In addition, it will also come with a fast-switching RGB
                        sub-pixel technology, which will almost completely eliminate fixed pattern noise and motion
                        blur.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The original HTC Vive put at-home virtual reality on the map, with its spot-on tracking and high
                        resolution screen. The competition has heated up since its 2016 debut, with the Oculus Quest
                        2 and Valve Index impressing VR gamers. But with the HTC Vive Pro 2, HTC is ready to re-stake
                        its claim as the premium VR headset manufacturer to beat when it comes to PC virtual reality.
                        And, in terms of its spec sheet, the HTC Vive Pro 2 is easily one of the most powerful, high-end
                        VR headsets out there.
                        With a 5K (2.5K to each eye) display targeting a silky-smooth 120Hz refresh rate, it’s the most
                        visually impressive VR headset we’ve ever put on our heads. It’s also one of the richest
                        sounding, thanks to its over-ear headphones and hi-res audio capabilities.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Price and availability</h3>
                    <p>
                        • Two package options available
                        <br>
                        • Premium technology at a premium price
                        <br>
                        • Existing Vive owners can save on the purchase of accessories again
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The headset-only variant will start at a special discount of £659 / $749 / €739. The complete
                        kit, which includes the Base Station 2.0 and the VIVE Controllers, is available , for £1299 /
                        $1399 / EUR1399.
                        This is definitely a premium-priced VR device, positioned similarly to the Valve Index, and
                        considerably more than the Oculus Quest 2 (which has lower specs to match its lower price). Bear
                        in mind that you'll also need a high-end PC to see the HTC Vive Pro 2 performing at its best.
